### Howdy, I'm Matt! (he/him)

I'm a full-stack sort of fella and am the Head of Engineering for [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com).

ðŸ’» The majority of my work life is spent in WordPress or WordPress adjacent projects where I work with piles of smart people within [StellarWP](https://stellarwp.com). I love to tinker with things, so I'm comfortable with both backend and frontend engineering, devops, and strategy.

ðŸŽ¨ Doodling is a side interest of mineâ€”I've illustrated a children's book and a couple of book covers; done some cheesey commissions; and I often try to find ways to have an artistic outlet at work, too, so I draw The Events Calendar [release mascots](https://www.artstation.com/borkweb/albums/3807820).
